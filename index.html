<h1>Arts Fire</h1>
  <p>Arts Fire is the art and creative talent division of <a href="http://www.baughholdingcompany.com">Baugh Holding Company</a>. Current projects are the <a href="http://www.the-liars-club.com">Liars Club</a> and the <a href="http://www.worldofwebb.net">World of Webb blog.</a></p>
  <p>Developers--I am not interested in making my boring, text only, two paragraph page anything more at this time. When I become interested I will only work with people or companies local to Richmond, VA. Last, there is some web site guy in India who has me on speed dial so I get ass dialed calls from India. Funny and a bit annoying.</p>
  <p>What do you mean Arts Fire? Are you sure it isn't Farts Ire? No, it's Arts Fire. Some poeple in this country are in a very meek, placating mood. They live afraid of making offense, of outraging someone. So their lives are dominated by a cloud of cacophonic voices telling them to be careful what they say, who they associate with, what they eat, where they live, and a legion of other niggling worries. It's a hell of a way to live.</p>
  <p>IMHO, the best art is triggering. It evokes feels. So it must be fearless. My vision for Arts Fire is a company that supports a community of creatives who produce good work even if it goes against the grain, maybe especially because it goes against the grain.</p>
  <p>And I'll stop here because what's next is a bunch of preaching on my opinion of going against the grain. Arts Fire is just me at the moment. A lot improves once there is one more and one more and one more creative, many more creatives building a community of cranky creatives.</p>
